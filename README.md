# Fast Oriented Text Spotting with a Unified Networkt
### Introduction
This is an implementation of [FOTS: Fast Oriented Text Spotting with a Unified Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01671.pdf)
### Install
+ Python3
+ tensorflow
+ OpenCV
### Model
Model pretrained on Synth800 for 6 epoch and finetuned on ICDAR15 [BaiduYunLink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BgkVHFaT91AptdwcTeJ2gg) keys:0aky
or [GithubLink](https://github.com/harish2704/FOTS_TF-data/blob/master/FOTS_checkpoint.zip) thanks for [harish2704](https://github.com/harish2704).
If you encounter problems, you can refer to [#16](https://github.com/Pay20Y/FOTS_TF/issues/16).
### Train
>> python2 multigpu_train.py --gpu_list=gpu_id --training_data_path=/path/to/trainset/

You should also change line 824 in icdar.py should be changed for the path of annotation file
### Test
>> python2 eval.py --gpu_list=gpu_id --test_data_path=/path/to/testset/ --checkpoint_path=checkpoints/
### Examples

### Differences from paper
+ Without OHEM
+ Pretrained on Synth800k for 6 epochs not 10 epochs
+ Fine-tuned on ICDAR15 only without ICDAR2017 MLT
+ And it can only get F-score 56 on ICDAR2015 testset, more training tricks are needed
